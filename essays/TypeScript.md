## Getting into TypeScript 

With my experience in JavaScript, Java, and C, TypeScript was both familiar and distant at the same time. Don't get me wrong, it's still the JavaScript I'm used to, but TypeScript's types do come in handy. When I went through the TypeScript tutorial, I was gobsmacked by the amount of material, like unions and interfaces, because I had no idea learning a new language would be so challenging. The introduction of interfaces, basic generics, and ES6 features (let/const, arrow functions, destructuring, and modules) is one of the significant things I've completed. I've achieved so far. The better autocomplete, more straightforward refactoring, and fewer "undefined" surprises are the main benefits of TypeScript if we're looking at it from a software engineering perspective. However, some projects may be challenging due to the setup. The hardest part for me was configuring the compiler section, particularly the tsconfig options and types for third-party libraries, as well as the additional compile step.

Compared to the other languages I know, Typescripts borrow a good part from each. From Java, it gives me types and clearer contracts without forcing everything into classes. From JavaScript, it's a superset, so it shares many commonalities. From C, I saw that static typing and type annotations were also present in TypeScript. 


## I'm an athlete, get me to the Olympics 

The first time I heard 'WOD', I spent a good deal of time thinking about what that meant, until it clicked in my head that we would be practicing with a workout of the day. The implementation of athletic software engineering is beneficial, even though it raises my heart rate, and the timer doesn't help out too. But that's how it should be; it exposes my weak spots and helps me pace myself to become a better software engineer. Working through some of the WODs and practicing through athletic software engineering will help me in the long run and make me comfortable with coding under pressure.

I believe TypeScript to be a good option, but it's not my first choice. When a project develops large, the light structure helps, and static typing helps identify errors early. However, I still prefer simple JavaScript when I'm starting a new project because it allows me to work quickly without requiring any setup. I'll use TypeScript when a project expands or otherwise requires it, as the WODs demonstrated. Right now, JavaScript works for me, but as my projects and abilities develop, I'm willing to change my mind.
