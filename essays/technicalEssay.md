I enjoy creating  things from scratch, which is why I find software programming appealing. The majority of my current knowledge is derived from class projects, short scripts, and a few programs in Java, JavaScript, and C. I enjoy it when a bug is finally understandable and can be fixed with change a line or just a character. I took APCSP in highschool and really enjoyed my time there. Something lit up for me and I thought that I should go into university with this.  


In the near future, I hope to master the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms, and program execution. In order to avoid breaking things when I refactor, I'm focusing on improving my ability to read error messages, using debuggers (VS Code for JS/TS, gdb for C), and creating brief unit tests for my code. In addition, I want to work on writing concise design notes, and effective commit messages that clearly describe my code. I'll be able to move more quickly and without guessing if I can accomplish those regularly.


On the product side, I want to take an organized approach to JavaScript:  TypeScript for fewer runtime surprises, and a straightforward API architecture using Node/Express. I'd like to learn how to use a relational database, write queries, and understand why an index is useful. For deployment, I don't need anything fancy yet: simply learn the fundamentals of things to come up during my career, build up a little CI workflow, and keep logs to see what's going wrong in production instead of assuming.
